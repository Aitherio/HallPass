# HallPass

-- See "BCIT_Hackathon_HallPass.jpg" for our team picture! --

Winning third place at the CST Co-op Hackathon in January 2018, HallPass is an enhanced map/web-based app that originated from the problem of "What does a BCIT student need."

Current maps available are not dynamic and do not contain a lot of information; HallPass was envisioned to be a dynamic map that can locate useful student utilities such as washrooms, microwaves, and power outlets. A map overview of the campus could display how many utilities are located in each building, and individual buildings could be clicked to display the floor plan, with specific utility locations shown. Upon clicking a specific utility, a write-up would appear that included a rating, as well as a general description of the utility.

The CST Co-Op Hackathon was an invitation-only event where Computer Systems Technology students with the highest term 1 GPAs were invited.

Teams of 5 were encouraged to practice agile software development and teamwork in a quick-paced environment.

The demonstration only contains 3 buildings' resources. To have the detailed information (which would eventually be expanded to all resources and buildings in a complete project), the SW01 North washroom information has been provided: "SW01_North_Washroom_Detailed.png"
